# RGEP
This is an implementation of Robust Gene Expression Programming (RGEP). This algorithm
was described in "Robust Gene Expression Programming: Treeless Expression Trees", my
master's thesis.


During grad school, I implemented this algorithm in Haskell. This implementation
is in Rust, making use of some similar ideas but starting fresh. I now prefer the
determinism of Rust, so I wanted to have this algorithm implemented in a fairly
fast way so I could experiment with it and Genetic Algorithms.


There is not likely much to see here, unless you are interested in RGEP or
Gene Expression Programming, which is quite cool. There is a fast implementation
of Point Mutation that could be used in other Genetic Algorithm code.



Enjoy!
